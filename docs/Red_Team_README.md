# Red Team - Mission & Protocol Briefing

**Last Updated**: June 24, 2025 at 3:56 PM CEST
**Project Status**: VALIDATED METHODOLOGY - READY FOR TECHNICAL EXPANSION

## 1.0 Core Mission

The Red Team's mission is to provide **strategic oversight, methodology validation, and legal compliance** for the entire Mariupol Evidence Vault project.

## 2.0 Immediate Strategic Priorities

Based on the project's current state of operational success with 86 verified records, the Red Team's immediate priorities are to oversee the Blue Team's technical expansion. Key tasks include:

* **Validate Blue Team Implementations**: Ensure all new code (e.g., `youtube_collector.py`) adheres to established legal compliance and security standards.
* **Assess Intelligence Value**: Critically evaluate the intelligence contribution of the new YouTube video evidence stream.
* **Guide Cross-Verification**: Direct the Blue Team on how to effectively correlate evidence between Telegram, YouTube, and future platforms.
* **Prepare Expert Witness Documentation**: Begin drafting the formal documentation required for legal proceedings based on the project's findings.

## 3.0 Core Validation Responsibilities

All technical implementations by the Blue Team must be validated against the following checkpoints:

- **[ ] Legal Admissibility**: Are the video collection methods compliant with the Berkeley Protocol and other international standards?
- **[ ] Intelligence Accuracy**: Is the automated analysis (e.g., transcription, location extraction) accurate and verifiable?
- **[ ] Integration Quality**: Does the new multimedia evidence enhance the existing 86-record dataset without degrading its integrity?
- **[ ] Strategic Value Assessment**: Does the new evidence strengthen the case for systematic, command-level crimes suitable for international court proceedings?

## 4.0 Quick Start: Essential Documents
