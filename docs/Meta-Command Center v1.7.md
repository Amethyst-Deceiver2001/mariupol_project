# Meta-Command Center v1.7

**Last Updated**: June 24, 2025
**Status**: ACTIVE - DUAL STREAM OPERATIONS
**Standing Directive**: This is the master control document for our collaborative intelligence framework. All sessions begin here. It provides strategic oversight for all operational streams and contains the definitive version of all system protocols.

### 2.0 MASTER GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL

#### 2.1 Protocol: Data Integrity & Source Validation (DISV)
1.  **Source Reliability Hierarchy**: External data sources will be assigned a reliability score based on their demonstrated accuracy during cross-referencing.
2.  **Multi-Source Mandate**: No critical data point will be considered "ground truth" without validation from at least two independent, high-reliability sources.
3.  **Data Confidence Scoring**: The application's data model will be updated to include a "confidence score" for key data points.
4.  **Automated Validation**: The development roadmap will include tasks to build automated validation checks within the application's codebase to flag potential data inconsistencies programmatically.

### 5.0 LIVE META-LOG
*(A log of strategic, system-level decisions and session outcomes.)*

* **2025-06-21**:
    * **Decision**: Established Meta-Command Center v1.0 to provide strategic oversight and governance.
    * **Decision**: Reactivated "Call of Dragons Engine" project.
    * **Decision**: Formalized the implicit "Personal Growth Track" into an explicit "User Development Framework" (Section 6.0).
* **2025-06-23**:
    * **Decision**: Completed translation of the formal data model into a modular Python codebase.
    * **Decision**: Advanced Call of Dragons Engine to functional application development.
    * **Decision**: Updated MASTER GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL with "Protocol 2.1: Data Integrity & Source Validation (DISV)".
    * **Decision**: Formalized the `Red/Blue Team AI Development Protocol`.
* **2025-06-24**:
    * **Decision**: Integrated new intelligence from "kovalev_mariupol_research.md" into the core evidence framework. This research identified systematic address manipulation as a tool for "administrative violence."
    * **Decision**: **Established the "Toponymic Intelligence Archive" as a formal project stream.** This creates a permanent, managed asset for all toponymic data, governed by the DISV protocol.
    * **Action**: Upgraded `Meta-Command Center` to v1.7, `Mariupol Command Center` to v2.1, and created `Toponymic Command Center v1.0`.
    * **Reflection**: The framework has evolved to treat intelligence not just as data, but as a core, governed asset. This allows for more sophisticated, multi-layered analysis, directly connecting cultural erasure with property crimes.
