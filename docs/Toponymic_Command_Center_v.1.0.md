# Toponymic Command Center v1.0

**Last Updated**: June 24, 2025
**Status**: ACTIVE - OPERATIONAL
**Source**: Meta_Command_Center_v1.7.md

### 1.0 CORE MISSION DIRECTIVE

To maintain and enhance a comprehensive, legally-admissible toponymic database documenting systematic cultural erasure and property seizure through address manipulation in occupied Ukrainian territories. This archive serves as a permanent, verifiable asset for legal proceedings, academic research, and future reconstruction efforts. The system is designed to expose "administrative violence" tactics where bureaucratic changes directly facilitate property theft.

### 2.0 MASTER DATA ASSET & FRAMEWORK

* **Primary Technical Framework**: `toponymic_db_fw.md`
* **Description**: The framework contains the `MARIUPOL_COMPREHENSIVE_TOPONYMIC_DATABASE`, a structured Python dictionary containing verified Ukrainian toponymy, documented occupation-era renamings, and specific case studies of address manipulation. It also includes the Python functions required to interact with and analyze this data.
* **Current Intelligence Basis**: `mariupol_street _renaming.md`, `kovalev_mariupol_research.md`

### 3.0 GOVERNANCE & UPDATE PROTOCOL

This project is governed by the "Data Integrity & Source Validation (DISV)" protocol from the Meta-Command Center. All updates must adhere to the following:

* **Multi-Source Mandate**: Any new renaming or address manipulation case (e.g., demolition-readdressing) must be validated with at least two independent, high-reliability sources.
* **Evidence-Based Updates**: Changes to the database must be linked to specific evidence, such as seizure notices, demolition orders, or official publications.
* **Chain of Custody**: A log will be maintained for all additions or modifications to the database to ensure legal admissibility, mirroring the practice of the Mariupol Evidence Vault.

### 4.0 OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

* **Data Integration**: The Python functions within `toponymic_db_fw.py` are the primary, approved tools for interacting with and verifying data against the master database.
* **Coordination**: This archive directly supports the `Mariupol Evidence Vault` project. The `process_evidence_v3_integrated.py` script is now dependent on this Command Center's master data asset for all address-related analysis.

### 5.0 LIVE ASSET LOG

* **2025-06-24**:
    * **Decision**: Formally established the Toponymic Intelligence Archive as a permanent asset under the Meta-Command Center.
    * **Action**: Integrated the `MARIUPOL_COMPREHENSIVE_TOPONYMIC_DATABASE` as the core asset, populated with intelligence from source documentation.
    * **Action**: Provided the enhanced database and functions to the `process_evidence_v3_integrated.py` script.
    * **Status**: Operational. Actively providing intelligence for legal-grade evidence production in the Mariupol Evidence Vault.
