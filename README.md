# Mariupol Evidence Project

**Status**: AWAITING RED TEAM REVIEW
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-24

## 1.0 Mission Directive

This project operates a legally compliant, Berkeley Protocol-standard evidence collection and analysis system. Its primary mission is to document systematic property seizures and reconstruction profiteering in occupied Mariupol, Ukraine, by correlating property crimes with toponymic manipulation (the systematic renaming of streets and locations).

The system is designed to produce evidence suitable for legal proceedings, command responsibility cases, and academic research into administrative violence.

## 2.0 Core Technologies

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Key Libraries**: pandas
* **Environment**: Python Virtual Environment (`venv`)

## 3.0 Setup and Execution

To set up and run the analysis, follow these steps from the project's root directory:

**Step 1: Configure Environment**
Create and activate the Python virtual environment.
```bash
python3 -m venv mariupol_env
source mariupol_env/bin/activate
